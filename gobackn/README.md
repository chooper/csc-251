Go-Back-N Simulation
====================

Work-in-progress that's supposed to impement to Go-Back-N protocol via a
simulator. Currently, I'm about halfway between alternating-bit and
Go-Back-N. I lost alot of time trying to figure out how to get this to
compile in Linux (and also my last C++ class was 7 years ago).
